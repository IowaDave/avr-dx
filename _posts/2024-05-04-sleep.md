# Power Naps

AVR microcontrollers give developers a number of ways to pursue low-current, long-lived battery operation. 

One technique is to ```sleep``` whenever the device is waiting for any length of time before the next task to begin. When a microcontroller is going to spend most of its time waiting, considerable power reduction can be achieved by means of a sleep mode compared to leaving the device in active mode.

During sleep, turn off as many peripherals as possible. Program code can configure each of the peripherals separately. But why go to the trouble, when there is a better way?

The Sleep Controller in a Dx device can turn *everything* off that does not need to run while sleeping, "making it easy to take it easy."

I mean, *really* easy. The following code segment would select the deepest, most power-thrifty sleep mode, "Power Down", enable sleeping, then enter sleep.

```
  SLPCTRL.CTRLA =
      SLPCTRL_SMODE_PDOWN_gc        // specify sleep mode
    | SLPCTRL_SEN_bm;               // enable sleep
    
  asm volatile ("sleep \n\t");      // enter sleep
```

A Dx microcontroller can reduce its power consumption to below 1 *micro*Amp in that mode. Call that its base load.

There are other sleep modes where some or most peripherals are kept running for faster, more responsive wake-ups. Those modes necessarily consume more power. See the data sheet, pages 114-121, for more information.

The device needs an interrupt to wake back up. An I/O pin could signal one coming in from outside. A small number of internal interrupt sources also could generate one. The Real Time Counter (RTC) peripheral's Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT) component is among them.

With the PIT running, a Dx controller can wake itself up from the deepest sleep at regular intervals ranging in length from about 122 microseconds up to 1 second.

The internal, "ultra-low-power 32K oscillator", named OSC32K, can supply the necessary clock frequency of 32,768 Hz to the PIT even during deepest sleep.

Together, OSC32K and the PIT consume around 1.7 microAmps. Adding the base load, a Dx can limit its current draw to fewer than 3 microAmps during Power Down sleep, holding all other peripherals off. Yet it can wake itself back up autonomously. 

<blockquote>
I first learned how to do this trick with an older type of AVR controller, the ATmega328P well known to fans of the Arduino Uno. It has a Timer2 peripheral that can be clocked by an external, 32K crystal oscillator. 
<br><br>
It adds labor and expense. One must purchase a crystal and solder it onto a certain pair of pins. The external part is necessary because our dear, old ATmega328P lacks an internal 32K oscillator. 
<br><br>
The Dx devices also can use an external crystal. They might even attain to a little better accuracy that way, as the OSC32K optimizes for low-power rather than for precision. However, when exactness of time is not essential, combining OSC32K with the PIT enables Dx controllers to do without an external clock source to wake themselves up from sleep at regular intervals.
</blockquote>

It will enter the PIT interrupt service routine (ISR) right away after waking up. Good practice is first to disable sleep and to clear the interrupt flag, as in the following code segment:

```
  SLPCTRL.CTRLA &= ~ SLPCTRL_SEN_bm;  // disable sleep mode
  RTC.PITINTFLAGS = RTC_PI_bm;        // clear the PIT interrupt flag
```

After the housekeeping, an ISR can do anything it wants.

The following program demonstrates Power Down sleep by keeping the controller in a minimal-current state almost all the time. A PIT interrupt wakes it up at 1/4 second intervals. The ISR keeps track of time and turns an LED on for one interval in every eight. It lights up for just 1/4 second every two seconds.

After the ISR ends, program execution jumps automatically to the ```loop()``` process where the device is put back to sleep.

The recurring code runs to completion in just a few microseconds. The device will be asleep and drawing minimal power more than 99.9% of the time. Battery life measured in weeks or months becomes possible.
